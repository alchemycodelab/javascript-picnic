# Alchemy Picnic!

For each picnic item:

-   Grab the element and save it as a variable
-   Add an event listener for clicking on the element
-   Toggle the class "picked" for the element (`classList` has a method called `toggle` similar to `add` or `remove`)

# Stretch

-   Add a button that will pick a random item from your picnic basket and add it to your picnic
-   Add drag and drop to your items (hint: drag and drop are events just like clicking)
